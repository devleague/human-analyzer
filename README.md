# DevLeague Data Analysis Challenge

### Title:  The Day Data Saved Humanity
### Organization: Humans4Future.org
### Industry:Human Survival Consulting and Intergalactic Space Travel
### Project Description:Data aggregation and projection
### Data Description:
  - Total applicant aggregate report from January 2014 - March 2017 (previous_years_raw_data.csv)
  - Raw applicant and score data from January 2017 - March 2017 (2017_1st_quarter_raw_data.csv)
### Welcome:
Hello new data wizard! Welcome to the Humans4Future organization. We are a human survival oriented organization tasked with persisting the survival of the human race as we explore new intergalactic territories. We recently had our Human Reproduction Data Specialist disappear mysteriously and we need to continue to plan for our Mars Relocation Project for the rest of the year. Human survival is at hand.

We do have some prior reports and this year's raw data file left by our previous analyst but we don’t know how to make projections for the rest of the year and we need your help. We get many applicants that are eager to colonize new territories on our Project Exodus mission but it is important we only take the best and brightest(and most reproductive) who can help to build a new colony on Mars. We collect and test all applicants for their overall score, so you have that information at your disposal. The data may not be fully clean but we’ll leave that up to you to decipher.

### Your Objective:
Given the data provided for previous years, we need you to calculate the following:
  - What is the average participants per month, per year, per gender?
  - What is the average score per month?
  - What is the average score per gender?
  - What month(s) have the biggest jump in participants?

Given the data provided for the first quarter (Jan-Mar) of 2017, we need you to calculate the following projections for the 2nd quarter (Apr-Jun) so we can plan accordingly for our next launch:
  - How many applicants can we expect for the second quarter?
  - What can we expect the average score of applicants to be by gender?
  - What suggestions can you make based on the formatting of the raw data to make this process easier in the future?

### Deliverable
Create a report from the 2017 YTD data that stakeholders can easily read.
  - Your report can be submitted  in a Google sheet, Excel sheet, Google doc, or Word doc.
  - Be creative, imagine you are presenting this to non-technical stakeholders. Think about visualizing your data.
  - Think about the data wholistically and separately, does it make sense to split your data up, does it make sense to have multiple reports?

Summarize your findings and process to present to stakeholders in the company. Explain any trends you are able to detect. 
  - Your summary may be submitted in a Google doc, Word doc, or PDF.
  - Please be detailed in your summary, detail your process and include any images, snapshots, links, or charts to help stakeholders interpret your findings.
