### Project Description:Data aggregation and projection
### Data Description:
  - Total applicant aggregate report from January 2014 - March 2017 (previous_years.csv)

### Welcome:
Hello new data wizard! Welcome to the Humans4Future organization. We are a human survival oriented organization tasked with persisting the survival of the human race as we explore new intergalactic territories. We recently had our Human Reproduction Data Specialist disappear (mysteriously) and we need to continue to plan for our Mars Relocation Project for the rest of the year. Human survival is at stake.

We need to project our supply of colonizers for the rest of the year. The previous analyst left some prior reports and this year's raw data, but we don’t know how to make the projections for how many people we will need to screen and process. 
We get many applicants that are eager to colonize new territories on our Project Exodus mission but it is important we only take the best and brightest(and most reproductive) who can help to build a new colony on Mars. We collect and test all applicants. Each applicant’s test results are summarized in an overall score. 

The data may not be fully clean but we’ll leave that up to you to decipher.

### Your Objective:
Given the test data provided for previous years, we need you to perform an analysis to make projections for the next quarter and improve our process so we can plan accordingly for our next launch. Some questions to keep in mind when performing your analysis: 

  - How many applicants do we get on average per month?
  - What percentage of those applicants are female (on average)?
  - How many applicants do we get on average for each of the 6 months for each gender?
  - Do any of the months stand out in any way? Should we prepare differently for any month(s)?
  - What is the average score per month?
  - What is the average score per gender?
  - How many applicants can we expect for the second quarter?
  - What can we expect the average score of applicants to be by gender?
  - What suggestions can you make based on the formatting of the raw data to make this process easier in the future?


### Deliverable
Create a report from the 2017 YTD data that stakeholders can easily read.
  - Your report can be submitted in a Google sheet, Excel sheet, Google doc, or Word doc.
  - Be creative, imagine you are presenting this to non-technical stakeholders. Think about visualizing your data.
  - Think about the data holistically and separately, does it make sense to split your data up, does it make sense to have multiple reports?

Summarize your findings and process to present to stakeholders in the company. Explain any trends you are able to detect.
  - Your summary may be submitted in a Google doc, Word doc, or PDF.
  - Please be detailed in your summary, explain in detail your process and include any images, snapshots, links, or charts to help stakeholders interpret your findings.
  - **Keep in mind the suggested questions are a starting point for you to begin your analysis. You are free to ask stakeholders for additional information or clarification if needed.**
